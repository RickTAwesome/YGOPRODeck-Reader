# YGOPRODeck-Reader
A program that reads .ydk files. It can be used to compare multiple decks and see the card ratios in each one, see how often a card comes up in each deck and hopefully much more in the future. (WIP)

Currently the program only works in the console through an IDE. At least as far as I know. Am planning on making this a full app some day, but as of right now I am simply too inexperienced to try something like this.
