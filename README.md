# YGOPRODeck-Reader
A program that reads .ydk files. It can be used to compare multiple decks and see the card ratios in each one, see how often a card comes up in each deck and hopefully much more in the future. (WIP)

Currently the program only works in the console through an IDE. At least as far as I know. Am planning on making this a full app some day, but as of right now I am simply too inexperienced to try something like this.

If you're wondering why all old sample decks (0.1.1 and 0.1.2) revolve around the Trickstar archetype, it's because I was playing Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution and I opened a bunch of Blue Angel Booster Packs. I really just wanted a playset of Mystic Mine, but I got unlucky and ended up with a bunch of Trickstar cards. Might as well make a deck for them.
And so I decided to write me a program to tell me which cards are most used in Trickstar decks. That's literally the entire story.
